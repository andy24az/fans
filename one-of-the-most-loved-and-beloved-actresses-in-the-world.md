Fran Drescher, 66 years old, best known for her role in the series "The Nanny" (Dădaca) from the `90s, revealed some time ago, while in Bucharest for an anti-cancer campaign , that she feels a little Romanian, considering that her great-grandmother was born in Focşani.
"I'm from Romania!"

"My great-grandmother is from Focşani and, many years ago, she emigrated to the USA. Now, after all this time, I am returning here, to the country from which she left. I feel at home in Romania. I am from Romania! We Romanians have an oval face, dark hair, big sad eyes. I think I look like a typical Romanian", said Fran Drescher when she visited Romania several years ago.
