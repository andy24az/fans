A lost painting by the great artist Pablo Picasso, discovered in the trash by an antiquarian collector and then displayed in the man's living room for decades, has been certified as an original. Its value exceeds 6 million euros!

Italian Luigi Lo Rosso was cleaning a cellar on the island of Capri when he came across a painting that caught his eye. Without thinking, he rolled up the canvas and took it home, where he framed it and displayed it in the family living room.

This is how it is that after Andrea Lo Rosso received an encyclopedia about the world of art from his aunt, he realized that the painting could be one of the works made by the Spanish painter Pablo Picasso. But his father didn't want to hear it either, so the painting hung in the family's living room for decades.
